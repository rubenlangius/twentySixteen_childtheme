# twentysixteen-child
A little child theme for the default  Wordpress Twenty Sixteen theme. 

In a quest for the perfect Wordpress theme, I came around the new twentysixteen theme. 
The one column post template was very similar to the design that was made beforehand, so I decided to use this theme as a base and save some time. 

Because twentysixteen is the default theme in wordpress, I thought it would be nice if I shared this online. As this is my first project on Github I would like it if someone participated. So feel free to contact me.
